    <h1>Easy Tortilla Pizza</h1>
    <p>
      This is an extremely easy/fast way to prepare a delicious pizza that is
      light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good
      that is can be devoured alone! I make this often when entertaining guests
      and it always goes fast. You can make any sort of topping variations. The
      one below is the classic way I usually prepare it. I cook this also with
      my family. Each person gets their own tortilla to, as my kids say,
      decorate.
